### About me 🧑‍💻
-----
👋 Hey there! I'm a software engineer who started out as a physicist working in computational physics and orbital mechanics, giving me a strong background physics and mathematics which bringing a analytical mindset to coding challenges.  

🚀 Along all my years of experience working as a software engineer, I've worked across the full software development spectrum:
- Primarily as a backend engineer, building robust and scalable systems
- Frontend development to create engaging user experiences
- DevOps and cloud infrastructure for reliable deployments
- AI/ML projects where I get to apply my analytical background
- Blockchain solutions exploring decentralized systems

🎓 Knowledge sharing is my passion: I spent 8 years teaching programming and data science, which gave me a knack for breaking down complex concepts. I also enjoy writing technical blog posts where I can share insights and help others learn.


💡 I'm always excited about:
- Learning new technologies
- Sharing knowledge with the community
- Solving problems
- Building efficient and scalable solutions
